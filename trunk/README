Current state at this checkin:
  Tracks & ages objects (fixed time, fixed number)
  Messaging works
  Preference system works
  Generally works, needs features, cleanup
  Filters work (although in-motion needs some tuning)
  Keyboard short-cuts work
  Help (somewhat limited)
  Icon caching implemented
    
Things to do:
  If bad password response seen, disable sending fix, considering is logged in, throw message
  Start from position/start from home
  Lock position
  Position bookmarks
  Press and hold on object brings up track, status, re-center map, etc menu
  Audio alarm and/or alert on station movement or severe weather
  Needs variation in lat/long to be considered in motion
  Lots of exceptions need to be more specifically handled
  Need to handle network CONNECT message (or do we?)
  Variable reporting rate depending on speed?
  Add splash screen
  Flesh out About page
  Need application icon
  How to add text description that shows up in Settings->Applications list
  Add OpenIntents.org versioning
  Support hiding object?
  Distance needs to be added to object aging algorithm
  Some way to handle stacked icons
  Tabbed view to show stations by age, distance from me, etc
  Use trackball to mouse-over on-screen icons
  Still some problem with initial position if no GPS (not using network, like MapActivity seems to be)
  
Done:
  Allow filtering out fixed, mobile, and/or weather stations
  Allow user to force orientation without opening keyboard
  Handle messages received and permit sending
  Coarse fix OK for .LV, must have GPS for .CP
  Clicking blue dot should show APRS data
  Show service status icon at top
  Hitting home from another activity screen leaves APRSService running in non-service mode
  Spinner list to jump to a callsign position
  Include program name and version in login
  Add keyboard shortcuts
  Center & Zoom should do updateMap() first
  Need better object icons
  Certain overlayed icons should be pre-generated for speed
  Cache any internally generated overlays
  
Considerations:
  How to handle received positions
  What to do if can't connect to server or gets disconnected
  What to do if service crashes
  
Known issues:
  Opening keyboard will disconnect/reconnect to server if not background mode
  Map redrawn every 10 seconds to update onTap messages (don't like this)
  
Design
  Server hands a list of APRSObjects to the UI thread. The list has no 
  duplicate callsigns, is limited to oaMaxObjects, and has no objects 
  older than oaObjectAgeLimit.  If oaWxStationsOnly is true, the list 
  will contain only weather stations.
  
Notes
  Database is scrubbed every 60 seconds
  Distance/heading from me is updated every 10 seconds
